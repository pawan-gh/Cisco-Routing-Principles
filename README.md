# 🌐 Cisco Routing Principles

This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a **multi-router enterprise network**, focusing on **routing protocols, VLAN segmentation, NAT, and ACL-based security**.  
It replicates a small-to-medium business environment where multiple departments connect securely through dynamic routing and controlled access policies.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

The objective was to simulate an enterprise network from the ground up — planning the IP structure, configuring routers and switches, and securing inter-departmental communication.  
All configurations were implemented and tested in **Cisco Packet Tracer**, with routing verified across multiple subnets.

## 🧱 Key Implementations

- **Subnetting with VLSM:** Efficient IP design for scalable multi-subnet environments  
- **Dynamic Routing:** Implemented and compared **RIPv2**, **OSPF**, and **EIGRP** for redundancy and efficiency  
- **VLAN Segmentation:** Configured inter-VLAN routing to isolate traffic between departments  
- **NAT / PAT:** Enabled internal hosts to access external networks securely  
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Controlled inbound and outbound traffic between VLANs  
- **DHCP Configuration:** Automated host IP assignment  
- **Connectivity Verification:** Used `ping` and `show` commands to test routing paths
